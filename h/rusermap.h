/** 
  getUseridByCertificate() gets the SAF Userid for a certificate, if one had been previously
  defined for that user.

  The certificate is a standard DER format certificate and must have the proper length passed
  in the second argument.  The useridBuffer must be at least 9 bytes or bad thing will happen.

  The saf return code is returned and must be 0 for success.  Non-Zero returns are further explained
  in the racfRC and racfReason values

  Please consult the following IBM doc for a full explanation of return codes:
